Hey there! I'm Serenity, a passionate Software Developer hailing from sunny Florida. When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying the great outdoorsâ€”whether it's at the beach, exploring springs, kayaking, reading, paddle boarding, or concert hopping. I'm always on the lookout for new adventures, especially when it's not too hot outside.



Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my projects and get a sense of what I can do. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore exciting opportunities. Let's create something amazing together!

I'm currently fluent in several programming languages and technologies, including.
